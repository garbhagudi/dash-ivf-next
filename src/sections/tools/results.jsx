          A lady with Average Fertility needs to play it safe. It means that her
          fertility status is not too good, but neither is it very bad. It also
          indicates that it is not long before the fertility levels will drop
          quickly. Such women are advised to plan for a child immediately and if
          there is no conception within 6 months, they need to meet up with a
          fertility expert and take the doctor’s advice.
        </p>
        <p className='mt-2'>
          In-principle, women with Average Fertility should be able to conceive.
          In case this does not happen, it is possible that there are other
          factors that are contributing to the observed infertility. These
          factors could be problems with the fallopian tubes, there may be
          infections in the female reproductive canal, the oocyte quality may
          not be good, there may be male factors also influencing conception
          etc.
        </p>
        <p className='mt-2'>
          It is advised that such women to meet up with a fertility expert as
          soon as possible and proceed as per their advice. Some investigations
          may be needed to understand the cause behind the observed infertility.

          This status indicates that the lady is at the peak of her reproductive
          life-span. All her indicators are positive and the time is best suited
          for planning a child. Women who fall in this group need not worry much
          about their fertility status. Their internal systems are primed and
          ready for reproduction.

          If women with “Best Fertility” status are planning to delay their
          plans of having a child by a few years, it may be better to freeze
          their eggs at this stage. The delay in child-bearing could be due to
          career reasons, personal reasons. It is recommended that such women to
          go for oocyte freezing. The technology of oocyte freezing is improving
          quickly and eggs may be frozen for years. The frozen “best” oocytes
          can be used for fertilization with the husband’s sperms at a later
          point of time.

        <p className='mt-2'>
          If a lady has a fertility quotient of “Best Fertility” and is still
          unable to conceive, there may be other factors at play. It is possible
          that there are male fertility is not optimum or there may be fallopian
          tube blocks or the oocyte quality has some problems or there may be
          infections that are preventing conception or it can be even be a
          thyroid related issue.

          A lady with a fertility quotient of “good fertility” is in good shape
          for having a child. There are one or two factors that have started to
          deteriorate but there is nothing alarmingly wrong. The hormone levels
          and the general health condition is good and there is no significant
          reason to be worried. Most couples with this fertility quotient should
          be able to conceive within a span of 1 year if they are having
          unprotected intercourse.

          One important point to note here is that a lady with a fertility
          quotient of “Good Fertility” can still find it difficult to conceive
          because there are various other factors that play a role. There could
          be problems with the fallopian tubes, there may be infections in the

          A lady with a fertility quotient of “Low Fertility” has to take things
          seriously. There are some things that are not as good as they should
          be. It can be the age, the BMI or the ovarian reserves may be
          depleting or multiple factors may be affecting fertility. A lady with
          “Low Fertility” can move to “Poor Fertility” rather quickly. Such
          women should meet a fertility specialist quickly and address the
          problem of infertility.

        <p className='mt-2'>
          One important point to note here is that some of the key factors
          affecting fertility cannot be rolled back. Once they deteriorate, they
          stay that way or become worse. So women with a fertility quotient of
          “Low Fertility” should move quickly, if they plan to have a child.

          It is recommended that such women to meet up with a fertility

          able to help such women conceive with the various artificial
          reproduction techniques that are available (Timed intercourse, IUI,
          IVF, IVF-ICSI, IMSI etc.)

          Women who get a rating of “Poor Fertility” for their fertility
          quotient are advised to meet a fertility specialist immediately. The
          algorithm gives this rating only if the situation is dire and only if
          it needs quick intervention. In most cases, this rating will be got if
          the age of the women is well past the “best fertility age range” and
          if the ovarian reserves are depleted significantly.
