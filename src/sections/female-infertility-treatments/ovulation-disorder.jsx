                  Ovulation abnormalities are among the most prevalent causes of
                  female infertility. Ovulation disorders are disruptions in the
                  development of an egg (also known as an oocyte or ovum) during
                  a woman&apos;s menstrual cycle caused by issues with the
                  control of reproductive hormones. Disorders are frequently
                  caused by situations such as:

                    Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism is caused by hypothalamic

                <p>
                  Symptoms of an ovulation issue vary depending on the reason
                  and the hormones that impact ovulation. Infertility may be the
                  only symptom in certain situations. Others are as follows:
                  <ul className="list-outside list-disc mt-2 space-y-2">
                    <li>Periods that are irregular or missing are common.</li>
                    <li>
                      Anxiety, despair, and anxiousness are examples of mood
                      shifts.

                    <li>
                      Weight fluctuations â€“ Weight growth is frequently
                      associated with hypothyroidism, while weight loss is
                      associated with hyperthyroidism.
                    </li>

                  Treatments for ovulation problems aim to improve the quality
                  and frequency of ovulation. Among the therapies are:

                  Fertility Medications:{" "}
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Fertility treatments, both oral and injectable, can encourage
                  the ovaries to make and release eggs. The majority of women
                  will react to an oral medicine that requires little
                  monitoring. If a patient does not react to oral medicine, she
                  will be started on injectable meds, which will require more
                  frequent monitoring by a doctor
                </p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-lg py-4">
                  Modifications in lifestyle:
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Patients are urged to undertake lifestyle changes in addition
                  to taking thyroid medication. Maintaining a healthy weight,
                  frequent exercise, and stress-relieving techniques are all
                  recommended.

                  Thyroid hormone replacement treatment:

                <p>
                  Thyroxine (T4) helps put thyroid levels back into normal
