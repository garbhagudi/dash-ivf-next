These sperms are then allowed to fertilize the egg outside the body, in the laboratory. This fertilization can happen if the sperm and eggs are kept close to each other (called conventional IVF) or are forced by pushing the sperm into the egg (through a process called ICSI). The fertilized eggs are then cultured and ‘grown’ in the lab in conditions that mimic the woman’s uterus. The fertilized egg gets all nourishment from the culture media that it is kept in. An embryologist monitors the growth of the embryo. When the embryo has grown sufficiently, it is either transferred into the uterus of the woman (called fresh embryo transfer) or is frozen for a future transfer (called frozen embryo transfer).',

Cryopreservation of spermatozoa is a well-established technique, and the normally used cryopreservation method is the slow-freezing method. Slow-freezing is done using a cryoprotectant using a slow decrease in temperature (low cooling rate). However, after thawing, this method shows a decrease in the quality of sperm parameters, which is essentially attributed to oxidative stress-induced changes and intracellular ice crystal formation. The sample is distributed in cryotubes after adding cryoprotectants, which lower their temperature slowly until they are ready to be frozen in liquid nitrogen, at a temperature of -196 °C. freezing and thawing steps there are chances of the sperms getting damaged. Sperm quality is not affected during the storage process.

There are certain factors that affect the production, function, or movement of the sperm.  If there is any abnormality in the quantity, quality, morphology, or motility of sperms, infertility can result.  There are a number of factors that contribute to male infertility such as injury or damage to the male reproductive organs, chronic health issues, lifestyle, etc.  IVF procedures have been a miracle in such cases to render the joy of fathering a baby.  While PESA and TESA are commonly known IVF procedures, there are other male procedures that could be helpful in treating infertility due to certain conditions.  To choose the right procedure, it is important to know the underlying cause.  The procedure, however, depends on the underlying condition which could initially be known through certain symptoms.',

It is the endometrium where the fertilized egg implants itself if the female conceives. A female’s body prepares the endometrium to host the embryo as a part of the period cycle each month. The endometrial thickness increases and decreases which is influenced by the hormones estrogen and progesterone and progenitor cell populations and inflammatory mediators.

MACS are helped to attain better pregnancy rates and reduce implantation failures therefore it is mainly employed in cases of poor implantation rate, repeated IVF failures, and high DNA fragmentation in sperms. Once the sperms are separated the eggs are fertilized by ICSI (Intracytoplasmic sperm Injection) which is a micromanipulation technique employed in IVF treatment where the healthy sperm is injected into the cytoplasm of the egg using a fine needle. ICSI does not depend upon the ability of the sperm to move on its own and attach itself to the egg. The cellular process of fertilization occurs inside the egg which has got to happen naturally. MACS  is indicated in patients with a higher index of DFI (DNA Fragmentation Index) greater than 25% which indicates poor DNA integrity. IVF/ICSI techniques are performed once the sperms are separated using MACS.',
