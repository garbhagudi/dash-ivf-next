        Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection [ICSI]

            When fertilization happens, the head of the sperm must attach to the
            outside wall of the egg. Once it sticks, the sperm pushes through
            the outer layer to the within of the egg (cytoplasm), where
            fertilization takes place.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-4'>
            Sometimes the sperm cannot penetrate the outer layer for several
            reasons. The outer layer may be thick which is hard for the sperm to
            penetrate, the sperm may be unable to swim. In these cases, a
            procedure called Intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can be
            done along with in-vitro fertilization (IVF) to help fertilization
            with the egg. During ICSI, one sperm is injected directly into the
            cytoplasm of the egg.

                  ICSI is a part of IVF. Since ICSI takes place in the lab, your
                  IVF treatment will not seem much different than an IVF
                  treatment without ICSI.
                </p>
                <p className='mt-2'>
                  As with regular IVF, the female partner will take ovarian
                  stimulating drugs, and your doctor will monitor your progress
                  with blood tests and ultrasounds. Once the female has grown
                  enough good-sized follicles, she will have egg retrieval,
                  where egg removal from your ovaries with a special
                  ultrasound-guided needle.
                </p>
                <p className='mt-2'>
                  Your male partner will provide their sperm sample that same
                  day (unless using a sperm donor or previously frozen sperm.)
                </p>
                <p className='mt-2'>
                  There are two ways that an egg may fertilize by IVF:
                  Traditional and ICSI. In Traditional IVF, 50,000 or more
                  swimming sperm are placed next to the egg during a laboratory
                  dish. Fertilization occurs when one among the sperm enters
                  into the cytoplasm of the egg. In the ICSI process, a tiny
                  needle micro-pipette injects a single sperm into the egg. With
                  either traditional IVF or ICSI, once fertilization occurs, the
                  embryo grows in a laboratory for 1 to 5 days before it gets
                  transferred to the woman’s uterus (womb).

            In addition to these, there could be some chromosomal or hormonal
            disorders or if a man has undergone surgical sterilization in the
            form of vasectomy.

            If you are suffering from any of the above symptoms, consulting a
            healthcare professional will help better delineate the underlying
            cause and decide the right mode of treatment or procedure. Once the
            cause is identified, the doctor could recommend a certain procedure.
            There are various procedures to treat male infertility.

            Will ICSI work? Success Rate:
          </h3>
          <div className='mt-4'>
            <p>
              ICSI fertilizes 50% to 80% of eggs. The success rate of IVF and
              ICSI is the same. Not all eggs get fertilized with ICSI-IVF.
              Fertilization isn’t guaranteed even when a sperm is injected into
              the egg.
            </p>
            <p className='mt-4'>
              Remember that fertilization rates don’t tell you the clinical
              pregnancy or birth rates. The ICSI process may give rise to the
              following problems:
            </p>
            <ul className='mt-4 list-inside list-disc'>
              <li>Some or all of the eggs could also be damaged.</li>
              <li>
                The egg might not grow into an embryo even after being injected
                with sperm.
              </li>
              <li>The embryo may stop growing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className='mt-4'>
              Once fertilization happens, a couple’s chance of giving birth to a
              single baby, twins, or triplets is the same if they have IVF with
              or without ICSI.
            </p>
          </div>

            Can ICSI affect a baby’s development?
          </h3>
          <div className='mt-4'>
            <p>
              If a woman gets pregnant naturally, there is a 1.5% to 3% chance
              that the baby will have defects. The defect associated with ICSI
              is similar to IVF but slightly higher than in natural conception.
            </p>
            <p className='mt-2'>
              The slightly higher risk of defects may be due to infertility and
              not the treatments used to overcome infertility.
            </p>
            <p className='mt-2'>
              Certain conditions have been associated with the use of ICSI, such
              as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Angelman syndrome, hypospadias, or
              sex chromosome abnormalities. They occur in far less than 1% of
              children conceived using this technique.
            </p>
            <p className='mt-2'>
              Some of the issues that cause infertility could also be genetic.
              For example, male children conceived with the utilization of ICSI
              may have equivalent infertility issues as their fathers.
